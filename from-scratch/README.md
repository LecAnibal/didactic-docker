# Docker from scratch 

Create an empty directory for this task and create an empty file in that directory with the name Dockerfile. You can do this easily by issuing the command touch Dockerfile in your empty directory.

Congratulations, you just created your first Dockerfile! Letâ€™s open the file in your favorite text editor!

Every Dockerfile must start with the FROM instruction. The idea behind is that you need a starting point to build your image. You can start FROM scratch, scratch is an explicitly empty image on the Docker store that is used to build base images like Alpine, Debian and so on.
The follow is a Dockerfile example :

```sh
FROM  scratch
ADD alpine-minirootfs-3.9.3-x86_64.tar.gz /
CMD ["/bin/echo", "hi my friends"]
```

next step , we have to compile this Dockerfile to generate a image

```sh
$ docker build -t my-docker-image  .
